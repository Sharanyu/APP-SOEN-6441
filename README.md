# Project Title

New York Employee Information Retrieval System

## Project Description

We have developed a flask application called “New York Employee Information Retrieval System”.
We have used MVC design pattern for our application. Model-View-Controller (MVC) is widely used
design pattern in software engineering industry. The system accepts user inputs and choices, in
return it provides information related to the requested query. The user is provided with a HTML
page where the user can choose. The user input is accepted by the system and converted to
parameterized query. We have used Python, SQLite, HTML in our application

## What is MVC

MVC (Model View Controller), in short, is a design pattern that is frequently used in projects because it leaves the project structured to make it easier to identify the application's components, comprehend how it is built, and to make maintenance easier. The project is divided into three modules:

|Name| Funcion
|------- | -------------- 
|Models | Responsible for business logic
|View | Responsible for the visual part
|Controllers | Responsible for the behavior of the visual part
